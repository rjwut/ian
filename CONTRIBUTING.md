You want to contribute to IAN's development? That's awesome! üëç Here's some information about how to best help:

### Report a bug or missing feature
[Check to see if I already know about it.](https://github.com/rjwut/ian/issues) If not, [submit a new issue](https://github.com/rjwut/ian/issues/new). Be sure to include any relevant details. For example, a bug report should include 1) a list of the specific steps which led to the error, 2) what you expected to happen, 3) what actually happened, 4) any error message you received (especially stack traces), and 5) any other information you believe would be helpful.

### Improve our knowledge of the Artemis protocol
If you're handy with a packet sniffer, you can be of great use helping us [document the Artemis protocol](https://github.com/artemis-nerds/protocol-docs). Create issues on that project with any information you discover (or, if you know HTML, you can submit a pull request on the documentation itself). Improvements to the protocol documentation are eventually implemented in IAN.

### Implement a feature or fix a bug
Are you a Java developer? Feel free to implement a feature or bug fix for IAN yourself! Fork the repository, apply the changes to your copy, then submit a pull request. Note, however, that any one version of IAN targets a specific version of *Artemis*, so be sure you aren't writing something that will be incompatible with the targeted version.
